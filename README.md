# Resume Builder Project in React using Redux 

This project was done under the guidance of [Educative](https://www.educative.io/projects/build-a-resume-builder-in-react-using-redux/).

## Project Description
In this project, we’ll create a web application that we can use to create a resume by answering a series of questions.

We’ll use the Formik library to build forms and Material UI to add different UI components in the application. We’ll use the Redux store to manage the states of the system while creating the resume through our application.

This project will let users complete a multi-step form that leads to the automatic creation of a resume. The user will be able to customize the template’s color and download the created resume in the PDF format. The user will also be able to go to any resume section by simply clicking the step at the top.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
